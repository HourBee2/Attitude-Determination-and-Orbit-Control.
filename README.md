# Attitude-Determination-and-Orbit-Control.
Library of Open Source projects for Attitude Determination and Orbit Control. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
- It is highly recommended to start with the theoretical and conceptual framework in the Lectures folder in the ADCS (Python & Jupyter Notebook) directory.
- Most of the projects utilize MATLAB; (Simulink is also a valuble tool in control engineering) which you can learn by undertaking the MATLAB and Simulink onboarding courses at [MATLAB](https://matlab.mathworks.com/).
- View the Attitude Determination Toolbox Report in the ADCS Toolbox Master (MATLAB) directory and run the project on MATLAB.
- ADCS (Python & Jupyter Notebook) directory is primarily in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

## üéà Prerequisites
- Theoretical and conceptual understanding of working principles of Attitude Determination and Orbit Control Systems.
- MATLAB.
